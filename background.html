    <h1 class="about-heading">About myself:</h1>
    <p class="about-text">Hello fellow internet user! My name is Vincent Ng and I was born in Hong Kong, and spent a majority of my life in the SF Bay area.
        My journey into coding began at age 10 on platforms like Scratch and Code.org, where I built simple games like hangman, tag, and tic-tac-toe. That early curiosity quickly evolved into a passion for programming, especially in understanding the algorithms and technologies that power the web.
        Since then, I have been hooked on building my programming skillset by exploring the underlying algorithms and languages behind our everyday websites, with an emphasis on AI/machine learning and deep learning applications.  
        My passion continuously grows at UC Davis, where I'm studying Computer Science, Statistics, and Technology Management, creating projects intertwining my personal interests and user experience.
        When I'm not behind a computer, I love to practice boxing, hike, lift weights, and explore new cuisines! 
        I'm looking forward to connecting!
    </p>
