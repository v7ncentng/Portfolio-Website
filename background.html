        <h1 class="about-heading">A bit about me:</h1>
        <p class="about-text">
          Hello fellow internet user! My name is Vincent Ng and I was born in Hong Kong, and spent a majority of my life in the SF Bay area. </p>
          <p class="about-text">My journey into coding began at age 10 on platforms like Scratch and Code.org, where I built simple games like hangman, tag, and tic-tac-toe. The early curiosity stemmed from connecting my childhood to software and evolved into a passion for programming that still burns as I reach my third year in UC Davis.</p>
          <p class="about-text">I have been especially hooked on building my programming skillset through fullstack projects, with an emphasis on AI/machine learning and deep learning applications.</p>
          <p class="about-text">My passion continuously grows at UC Davis, where I'm studying Computer Science, Statistics, and Technology Management, creating projects intertwining my personal interests and user experience.</p>
          <p class="about-text">When I'm not behind a computer, I love to practice boxing, hike, lift weights, and explore new food cuisines!</p> 
          <p class="about-text">I'm looking forward to connecting!</p>
